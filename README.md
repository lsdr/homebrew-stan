# Stan's Previously-Owned Homebrew Formulae

List of formulae I either wrote and/or forked (then mangled) for personal use. Feel free to do the same.

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap lsdr/stan` and then `brew install lsdr/stan/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:
```
brew install https://raw.github.com/lsdr/homebrew-stan/master/<formula>.rb
```

## Stan?
[Smilin' Stan S. Stanman][stan-bio] is one of the funniest characters of Monkey Island. I used to laugh a lot with his "previously owned" shops and merchandise while playing Monkey Island. This seems like a just homage to Stan's legacy.
