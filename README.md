# Stan's Previously-Owned Homebrew Formulae

List of formulae I either wrote and/or forked (then mangled) for personal use. Feel free to do the same.

I try and avoid conflicts with the base formulae as much as I can. If you feel like contributing, please do the same.

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap lsdr/stan` and then `brew install lsdr/stan/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:
```
brew install https://raw.github.com/lsdr/homebrew-stan/master/<formula>.rb
```

## Other Taps

Check [homebrew/wiki/Interesting-Taps-&-Branches](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Interesting-Taps-&-Branches) for other useful taps.

## Stan?
[Smilin' Stan S. Stanman][stan-bio] is one of the funniest characters of Monkey Island series. I used to laugh a lot with his "previously owned" shops and merchandise. This seems like a just homage to Stan's legacy.
